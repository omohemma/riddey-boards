# Riddey Board
___
### Task 
Implement this figma design as follows.
 - Only the content on the card is required, the background of the page can be plain gray and the blurred elements in the background can be omitted. 
 - Use React to implement the design. 
 - Use vanilla-extract for styling 
 - If the button is pressed, the board counter (x out of 10 boards in use) and its progress bar should be increased by one. (Start it from zero.) If the counter has reached 10 then make the button disabled. 
 - Use semantic html.
 - The progress bar should moves smoothly.
 - The button should have a hover (bgcolor: #B55147), an active (bgcolor: #883D35) and a disabled (opacity: 0.4) state with 200ms transition duration.
 - Use TypeScript. 
 - Please send a Github link of your solution.
 - Please donâ€™t use an app generator (Create React App or similar)

### Nice to haves: 
- Install the app somewhere (and share its URL with us). 
- Your solution looks exactly the same on both Chrome and Firefox.
